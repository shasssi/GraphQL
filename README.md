##### Typescript

`Typescript - it is build on javascript with type checking features.`
`Typescript helps to hight the error in editor itself while writing the code which lowers the chance of bugs.`

##### REST

`It stands for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style that provides a simple and uniform interface for sharing resources between a client and a server.`

`Language agnosticism: REST APIs can be implemented in any language that supports HTTP without needing any additional support or communication layer.`

##### Graphql

`GraphQL uses HTTP as its transport protocol, and it enables you to perform three operation types: queries, mutations, and subscriptions.`

`GraphQL provides a single endpoint for all operations. This simplifies the structure of the API’s URL and eliminates the need to maintain multiple paths or routes in an API.`

`GraphQL provides a mechanism that allows clients to specify and receive the exact data they need. This reduces the risk of over-fetching and under-fetching data and improves the efficiency of network requests, since only necessary data objects are transmitted.`

`Strongly typed schema: GraphQL requires a schema that defines the data types and relationships between each type. The schema provides clients with a description of the data that is available to them.`

##### Prisma

`Prisma is an open-source ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. It is used as an alternative to writing plain SQL, or using another database access tool such as SQL query builders (like knex.js) or ORMs (like TypeORM and Sequelize). Prisma currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB and CockroachDB (Preview).`

##### Redis

`Redis is an Open Source store for storing data structures. It is used in multiple ways. It is used as a database, cache, and message broker. It can store data structures such as strings, hashes, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, indexes, and streams. Redis is very useful for Node.js developers as it reduces the cache size which makes the application more efficient. However, it is very easy to integrate Redis with Node.js applications.`
